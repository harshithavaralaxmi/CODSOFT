ROCK PAPER SCISSOR :

The provided code is a simple implementation of a Rock, Paper, Scissors game using the Tkinter library in Python. Tkinter is used for creating the graphical user interface (GUI). The game involves a player and a computer making choices between Rock, Paper, and Scissors, and the winner is determined based on the rules: Rock beats Scissors, Scissors beats Paper, and Paper beats Rock.

Here's a breakdown of the code:

GUI Setup: The code sets up a basic GUI window with a title ("Rock Paper Scissor Game") and a size of 300x300 pixels.

Game Logic:

The computer's choices are predefined as "Rock," "Paper," and "Scissors."
Functions like isrock(), ispaper(), and isscissor() are defined to handle player actions for each choice.
After the player makes a choice, the computer randomly selects its choice, and the winner is determined based on the game rules.
The results are displayed in the GUI, indicating whether the player wins, loses, or the match is a draw.
Buttons and Labels: The GUI includes buttons for the player to select Rock, Paper, or Scissors. Labels are used to display player and computer choices, and the result of each match is shown in a larger label.

Reset Functionality: There is a "Reset Game" button that resets the game, allowing the player to make new selections.

Button States: The code includes functions to disable buttons after a choice is made to prevent further selections until the game is reset.

Overall, the code provides a simple and interactive Rock, Paper, Scissors game with a user-friendly interface.
