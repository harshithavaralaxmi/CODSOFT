ROCK PAPER SCISSOR :

The provided code is a simple implementation of a Rock, Paper, Scissors game using the Tkinter library in Python. Tkinter is used for creating the graphical user interface (GUI). The game involves a player and a computer making choices between Rock, Paper, and Scissors, and the winner is determined based on the rules: Rock beats Scissors, Scissors beats Paper, and Paper beats Rock.

Here's a breakdown of the code:

GUI Setup: The code sets up a basic GUI window with a title ("Rock Paper Scissor Game") and a size of 300x300 pixels.

Game Logic:

The computer's choices are predefined as "Rock," "Paper," and "Scissors."
Functions like isrock(), ispaper(), and isscissor() are defined to handle player actions for each choice.
After the player makes a choice, the computer randomly selects its choice, and the winner is determined based on the game rules.
The results are displayed in the GUI, indicating whether the player wins, loses, or the match is a draw.
Buttons and Labels: The GUI includes buttons for the player to select Rock, Paper, or Scissors. Labels are used to display player and computer choices, and the result of each match is shown in a larger label.

Reset Functionality: There is a "Reset Game" button that resets the game, allowing the player to make new selections.

Button States: The code includes functions to disable buttons after a choice is made to prevent further selections until the game is reset.

Overall, the code provides a simple and interactive Rock, Paper, Scissors game with a user-friendly interface.



TO-DO-LIST:


The provided code is a simple To-Do List application implemented using the Tkinter library in Python. Tkinter is used for creating the graphical user interface (GUI) for the application. The To-Do List allows users to enter tasks, display them in a text area, and delete tasks by specifying the task number.

Here's a breakdown of the code:

GUI Setup:

The GUI window is created with a light green background and a size of 250x300 pixels.
Labels, entry fields, buttons, and a text area are added to the GUI for different functionalities.
Functions:

inputError(): Checks if the task entry field is empty and shows an error message if so.
clear_taskNumberField(): Clears the content of the task number entry field.
clear_taskField(): Clears the content of the task entry field.
insertTask(): Inserts a task into the text area, increments the task counter, and clears the task entry field.
delete(): Deletes a specified task based on the task number, decrements the task counter, and updates the text area.
Widgets:

Labels: "Enter Your Task" and "Delete Task Number."
Entry Fields: For entering tasks and specifying task numbers.
Buttons: "Submit" for adding tasks, "Delete" for deleting tasks, and "Exit" for closing the application.
Text Area: Displays the list of tasks.
Grid Layout:

Widgets are arranged in a grid layout to organize their placement in the GUI window.
Main Loop:

The mainloop() function is called to start the GUI and handle user interactions.
Overall, the code provides a basic To-Do List application with a user-friendly interface, allowing users to add, view, and delete tasks.


CALCULATOR:

The provided code is a simple calculator application created using the Tkinter library in Python. Tkinter is used to build the graphical user interface (GUI) for the calculator. The calculator supports basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

Here's a breakdown of the code:

GUI Setup:

The GUI window is created with a title "Calculator-GeeksForGeeks."
A frame is added to the window with a light blue background and padding.
An entry widget is created for displaying and entering numerical values.
Calculator Functions:

The myclick(number) function is used to update the entry field when a number or operator button is clicked.
The equal() function evaluates the mathematical expression entered in the entry field and displays the result.
The clear() function clears the content of the entry field.
Buttons:

Number buttons (0-9) are created to input numerical values.
Operator buttons (+, -, *, /) are provided for basic arithmetic operations.
Clear button resets the entry field.
Equal button calculates and displays the result.
Grid Layout:

Widgets are arranged in a grid layout within the frame to organize their placement in rows and columns.
Main Loop:

The mainloop() function is called to start the GUI and handle user interactions.
Overall, the code implements a straightforward calculator with a user-friendly interface, allowing users to perform basic arithmetic calculations.
